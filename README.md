**Omics code**
Apart from end-to-end pipelines I use (please visit my Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/goutham-vasam-404a221a/ 'About' section) for omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, etc.) analysis on various platforms, and by using Python and R, sample code here can be used for dimensionality reduction and classification of any of the Omics data types.
