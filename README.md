**Omics and image data analysis code**

**Omics code**
Apart from end-to-end pipelines I use for omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, etc.) analysis on various platforms, and by using Python and R, sample code here can be used for dimensionality reduction and classification of any of the Omics data types.

**Image classification code**
For the purpose of placental histopathological image classification towards a bigger project (studying a novel inflammatory subclass of preeclampsia) in my Postdoctoral research, which will lead to several publications - including one in a high-impact journal during next 1-2 years, I have developed this code.
